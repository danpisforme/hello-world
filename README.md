# hello-world
just setting up my git-hub

Hey everyone,

I'm studying finance at UAB, but I've also discovered a passion for technology so I've taken out a CS minor. I'm currently in intro to CS that leverages python as a means to learn CS concepts. I just wanted to fire up a git hub and become more familiar with the platform, and eventually contribute to projects!
